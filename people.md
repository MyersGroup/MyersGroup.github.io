Our group is based jointly at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk), and the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk). We are broadly interested in answering questions in statistical, population, and medical genetics. We develop and apply model-based computational techniques, and perform lab-based research. One strong focus of the groups’ research is the study of the basic biological process of recombination, and its links to fertility and health in mammals. A second focus is inference of  fine-scale population structure – within individual countries – and the genetic impacts of migration events, in humans and other species.

I am a postdoc investigating “admixture events” between human populations. These occur when two or more previously separated populations come together, leading to individuals carrying a mixture of ancestries. Specifically, I am developing a new approach to allow identification of individual ancestry segments within such individuals, inferring the nature of the events – including the groups which mixed – without prior knowledge. I’m also a Junior Research Fellow at [Mansfield College](https://www.mansfield.ox.ac.uk/).

I am a postdoc working on the resolution of recombination. Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DNA double strand breaks, which can resolve as crossovers (COs) or as non-crossover gene conversions (NCO). Although most DSB’s resolve as NCO’s, many basic properties of these events remain uncertain, because short NCO tracts are often difficult to detect.

We have studied this process using data from mice, greatly increasing our power to detect NCO’s in an unbiased fashion. A particular focus is the impact of the variability and binding of the DNA-binding protein PRDM9, a gene the Myers lab [previously identified](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828505/) as controlling recombination positioning in humans and other mammals, on these events.

I am a postdoc performing experimental lab-based research to study recombination, and its links to speciation, in mammals. I leverage a variety of experimental techniques including ChIP-Seq, fertility assays, transfection, and the investigation of protein-protein interactions.

## Dr Zhangyi He:

I am a postdoc working on the Wellcome-Trust funded project: “Building a platform for genetic inference from the Genomics England data”, supervised by Professor Jonathan Marchini and Professor Simon Myers. During the 3-year lifetime of this project, Genomics England (GEL) will deeply sequence 100,000 complete human genomes from approximately 70,000 individuals, sampled across a range of rare disease phenotypes, cancer patients, and healthy individuals. We are responsible for leading the development and implementation of new statistical analysis tools, enabling the research community to leverage the GEL data in studies of human phenotypes, by allowing phasing and imputation of extremely low frequency variants. Within the same unified analysis framework, we will also develop approaches to characterize the fine-scale genetic structure of the English population at an unprecedented level, providing knowledge for population structure matching and adjustment for such phenotypic studies.

I am a DPhil student interested in shedding light on demographic history by studying patterns of genetic variation. The Iberian Peninsula has undergone a complex history of population isolation, migrations and invasions from other regions, such as North Africa and parts of Europe. I am applying powerful haplotype-based statistical methods to detect and explain the population genetic structure of Spain. Characterising and quantifying the genetic impact of demographic events involving populations from outside of the Peninsula is also a key focus of my research. The Iberian Peninsula provides a unique opportunity to test new admixture models in a setting which involves complex admixture events among relatively closely-related populations.
