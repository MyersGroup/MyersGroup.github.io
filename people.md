## Prof. Simon Myers

<span class="image left"><img src="images/simon_myers.png" /></span>

Our group is based jointly at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk), and the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk). We are broadly interested in answering questions in statistical, population, and medical genetics. We develop and apply model-based computational techniques, and perform lab-based research. One strong focus of the group’s research is the study of the basic biological process of recombination, and its links to fertility and health in mammals. A second focus is inference of  fine-scale population structure – within individual countries – and the genetic impacts of migration events, in humans and other species.

## Dr Emmanuelle Bitoun

<span class="image right"><img src="images/bitoun.png" /></span>

I am a postdoc performing experimental lab-based research to study recombination, and its links to speciation, in mammals. I leverage a variety of experimental techniques including ChIP-Seq, fertility assays, transfection, and the investigation of protein-protein interactions.

## [Dr Christopher C. Gill](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~gill/)

<span class="image left"><img src="images/gill.jpg" /></span>

I am working with the ancestry company [LivingDNA](https://www.livingdna.com/). This is part of the Systems Approaches to Biomedical Sciences ([SABS](http://www.sabsidc.ox.ac.uk/)) doctoral program. I am currently interested in developing statistical tools and pipelines to provide new insights into genetic ancestry estimation.

Having completed my degree in 2006, covering a wide range of mathematical topics, I went on to complete a DPhil, focussing on the representation theory of finite groups. Much of my time was spent studying questions related to the decomposition numbers. More specifically, I studied properties of Young modules, an important aspect of the representation theory of the symmetric group, and more generally trivial source modules for finite groups. I spent several years pursuing research in this area, whilst enjoying a considerable amount of teaching. I held positions at Charles University in Prague, and at Somerville College and Keble College in Oxford. In 2015 I decided to pursue a more interdisciplinary approach to research in the biological/biomedical setting.

## Sinan Shi

<span class="image right"><img src="images/sinan_shi.jpeg" /></span>

I am a DPhil student co-supervised by Prof. Simon Myers and Prof. Pier Palamara, working on the phasing and imputation of 100,000 Genomes Project of Genomics England. Previously, I worked as a research software engineer in various research institutes.

## Miriam Stricker

<span class="image left"><img src="images/miriam2.png" /></span>

I am a DPhil student co-supervised by Prof. Pier Palamara (Systems Approaches to Biomedical Sciences CDT, collaboration with Satu Nahkuri, Roche). My current research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms to study how variation in non-coding parts of the genome influences the epigenetics and expression levels of coding parts of the genome, with applications within cancer immunotherapies. Before joining the lab I worked in Biophysics and obtained degrees from Heidelberg University.

## Luis Torada Aguilella

<span class="image right"><img src="images/luis.jpg" /></span>

I am a DPhil student co-supervised by Robert Davies and Simon Myers at Oxford, as well as Satu Nahkuri and Tony Kam-Thong at Roche. I am currently investigating genetic heterogeneity within Autism Spectrum Disorder. Before coming to Oxford, I did a BSc in Biochemistry at University of Navarra (Spain) and a MSc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology at Imperial College London (UK). I then joined the Systems Approaches to Biomedical Science Doctoral Training Center (SABS DTC) at Oxford, starting my DPhil in Nov 2019. My current project reflects my major research interest: large-scale dataset modelling with health impact.
