Our group is based jointly at the Department of Statistics, and the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. We are broadly interested in answering questions in statistical, population, and medical genetics. We develop and apply model-based computational techniques, and perform lab-based research.One strong focus of the groups’ research is the study of the basic biological process of recombination, and its links to fertility and health in mammals. A second focus is inference of  fine-scale population structure – within individual countries – and the genetic impacts of migration events, in humans and other species.

I am a postdoc investigating “admixture events” between human populations. These occur when two or more previously separated populations come together, leading to individuals carrying a mixture of ancestries. Specifically, I am developing a new approach to allow identification of individual ancestry segments within such individuals, inferring the nature of the events – including the groups which mixed – without prior knowledge. I’m also a Junior Research Fellow at [Mansfield College](https://www.mansfield.ox.ac.uk/).

I am a postdoc working on the resolution of recombination. Meiotic recombination is initiated by programmed DNA double strand breaks, which can resolve as crossovers (COs) or as non-crossover gene conversions (NCO). Although most DSB’s resolve as NCO’s, many basic properties of these events remain uncertain, because short NCO tracts are often difficult to detect.

We have studied this process using data from mice, greatly increasing our power to detect NCO’s in an unbiased fashion. A particular focus is the impact of the variability and binding of the DNA-binding protein PRDM9, a gene the Myers lab [previously identified](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828505/) as controlling recombination positioning in humans and other mammals, on these events.
