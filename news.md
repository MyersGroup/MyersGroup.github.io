Breaking news is that Simon has been awarded the 2017 [Francis Crick Medal and Lecture](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/francis-crick-lecture/) by the Royal Society “for transforming our understanding of meiotic recombination and of human population history. ” The prize lecture will be delivered in December 2017.

This prestigious prize is a great recognition of the contribution that Simon is making to understanding key aspects of genetics.

Robbie and Simon (along with coauthors) have published a Nature Genetics paper detailing the STITCH method for [Rapid genotype imputation from sequence without reference panels](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3594.html). This method allows for imputation based only on sequencing read data, without requiring additional reference panels or array data. The approach is accurate even in settings of extremely low sequencing coverage. For example, accurate imputation of 5.7 million SNPs at a mean r2 value of 0.98 in 2,073 outbred laboratory mice is achieved (0.15× sequencing coverage). In a related paper, also in Nature Genetics today, STITCH is used to do [Genome-wide association of multiple complex traits in outbred mice](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3595.html).

We are hiring! There are [2 positions in Statistical Genetics Methods Development](http://tinyurl.com/hy8gd7v) and  [1 position in Statistical Genetics Software Development](http://tinyurl.com/z3w3ttb). The full-time positions are funded by the Wellcome Trust and are fixed-term for 3 years. These positions will focus on analysing data gathered by Genomics England (GEL). GEL will deep sequence the complete genomes of approximately 70,000 individuals, sampled across diverse rare disease phenotypes, cancer patients, and healthy individuals. Funding is via a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award, and these positions will be supervised jointly by Prof Myers and [Prof Jonathan Marchini](https://jmarchini.wordpress.com/).

The closing date for applications is 1 June 2016.

## 23 February 2016.
The 2nd [Probabilistic Modeling in Genomics Conference](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/events/probgen16) (ProbGen16), will be held at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, UK.

Monday 12th September – Wednesday 14th September 2016

Organisers: Jonathan Marchini, University of Oxford, UK; Simon Myers, University of Oxford, UK; Jotun Hein, University of Oxford, UK; Peter Ralph, University of South California, USA

A study by a team including 5 members of the Myers Group has published a paper in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7589/full/nature16931.html) that shows the role the PRDM9 gene plays in speciation. This was achieved by completely restoring fertility in normally infertile hybrids of two mouse subsepecies, by the insertion of a human equivalent of the PRDM9 gene.

Robbie is writing up his DPhil thesis and has found employment! He will be working with [Genomics plc](http://www.genomicsplc.com/) in Oxford as a Statistical Bioinformatician / Geneticist.

We had burgers and a few beers to mark the departure of Nick this week. Nick is off to do a second PhD in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley.

## March 2015.
The People of the British Isles paper appeared in [Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7543/full/nature14230.html). This paper leverages some of the recent work done by the Myers group and “shows that subtle variations in the genetic make-up of modern Britons reflect the history of their islands’ colonisation by peoples from mainland Europe since the last Ice Age.” (credit: Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics)

## February 2014.
“A genetic atlas of human admixture history” appeared in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/747). In this study, which attracted considerable press attention, we developed and applied to a large dataset of 1500 individuals from 94 populations, a model-based approach to identify, and date, mixing events among human populations. The work is the first to describe, in detail, how the DNA of most humans is affected by such events, and discovers impacts on our DNA of recorded historical events, e.g. the Mongol empire.
