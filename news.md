Breaking news is that Simon has been awarded the 2017 [Francis Crick Medal and Lecture](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/francis-crick-lecture/) by the Royal Society “for transforming our understanding of meiotic recombination and of human population history. ” The prize lecture will be delivered in December 2017.

This prestigious prize is a great recognition of the contribution that Simon is making to understanding key aspects of genetics.

Robbie and Simon (along with coauthors) have published a Nature Genetics paper detailing the STITCH method for [Rapid genotype imputation from sequence without reference panels](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3594.html). This method allows for imputation based only on sequencing read data, without requiring additional reference panels or array data. The approach is accurate even in settings of extremely low sequencing coverage. For example, accurate imputation of 5.7 million SNPs at a mean r2 value of 0.98 in 2,073 outbred laboratory mice is achieved (0.15× sequencing coverage). In a related paper, also in Nature Genetics today, STITCH is used to do [Genome-wide association of multiple complex traits in outbred mice](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3595.html).
